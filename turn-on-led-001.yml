      # Welcome to the Edrys -  turn-on-led-001 - challenge

      This is a simple exercise to get you started with Arduino development.

      In this exercise you will need to write a program that will turn the built-in LED on.


      ## Open a station

      To get started, open the station where the code editor will be available.

      If you own this course, simply open the settings by clicking onto the
      gear-symbol, switch to "station" settings and open or share the link.

      Otherwise simply copy the entire url and replace `classroom` by `station`
      ...


      Afterwards a new station will appear on the navigation bar on the left.
      Click on it and you will be redirected to the station.

          Turn On LED

          Turns on the built in LED on the arduino board.

          Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
          model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
          https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
