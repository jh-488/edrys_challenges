      # Welcome to the Edrys -  Missing LED - challenge 

      After starting the challenge, 2 LEDs out of the 3 will be turned on. 
      
      You will need to write a program that will turn on the missing one and turn off the other LEDs.


      ## Open a station

      To get started, open the station where the code editor and the challenge module will be available.

      The station will appear on the navigation bar on the left.
      Click on it and you will be redirected to the station.
