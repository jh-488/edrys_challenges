      # Welcome to the Edrys -  turn-on-led - challenge (Time restricted)

      This is a simple exercise to get you started with Arduino development.

      In this exercise you will need to write a program that will turn the built-in LED on, before the timer runs out.

      To start making changes in the editor you need to start the timer.


      ## Open a station

      To get started, open the station where the code editor and timer will be available.

      The station will appear on the navigation bar on the left.
      Click on it and you will be redirected to the station.

          Turn On LED

          Turn on the built in LED on the arduino board.

          Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
          model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
          https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
